# python automation snippets

Hello Github! 
After completing 3 years of professional (?) python programming experience here I feel I have to start contributing to the community. 

As a beginning I am about to add automating snippets for windows users based on Python. 

Repository will be always open for contribution and enhancement!

Happy coding!
